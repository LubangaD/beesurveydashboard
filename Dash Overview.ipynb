    "# Dash: A Python Framework for Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dash** is a powerful Python framework for building web applications, especially suited for data visualization. It's commonly used to create interactive, customizable dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts in Dash\n",
    "\n",
    "The main things you need to understand about Dash are its **components**. These components act as building blocks for your application and allow you to create dynamic, data-driven user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dash Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Dash provides a set of components that form the core of any Dash application. These components allow you to create everything from inputs to sliders and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more about Dash components [here](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Plotly Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly components allow you to integrate Plotly graphs within your Dash application. These are essential for adding data visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore Plotly components [here](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Plotly Express is Plotlyâ€™s high-level API for rapid figure generation. It helps create various Plotly visuals easily, with each chart type accepting different parameters. For more information, visit the [Plotly Express Documentation](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Callback Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callback components** are what connect your Dash components and Plotly graphs to create interactivity. They allow your app to react to user input by updating the content dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more about callbacks [here](https://dash.plotly.com/basic-callbacks).\n",
    "> **Note:** In Dash, the children attribute is used to specify the content inside components (like table cells in this case). It's a powerful way to update and display content dynamically in response to user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structuring a Dash App\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember:\n",
    "- All the **Dash components** and **Plotly graphs** will go into the **app layout**.\n",
    "- The **callback functions** will be defined **outside** the app layout, linking the components together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will be connecting the Dash components and Plotly graphs using **callback components** to make them interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "# Getting Started with Dash and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through setting up a new Dash project, initializing it with Git, creating a virtual environment, managing libraries with `requirements.txt`, and posting your project to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Create a Project Folder\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start by creating a new folder for your Dash project.\n",
    "- Open the folder in **VS Code**. This folder will act as the repository for all your project files, ensuring everything is organized in one place for easy version control using Git and GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment helps manage your project's dependencies without affecting global libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your **Git Bash** terminal or **VS Code** terminal.\n",
    "2. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **For Windows**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python -m venv venv\n",
    "     source venv/Scripts/activate\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **For Mac/Linux**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python3 -m venv venv\n",
    "     source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After activation, your terminal prompt should show `(venv)` indicating that the virtual environment is active.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Add the Virtual Environment to `.gitignore`\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure your virtual environment directory is not tracked by Git, you should add it to a `.gitignore` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root directory (if it doesn't already exist):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   touch .gitignore\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open the `.gitignore` file and add the following line:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   venv/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "or   **Add the virtual environment directory to your `.gitignore` file** if you haven't already:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   echo \"venv/\" >> .gitignore\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This ensures that Git will ignore this directory in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Commit the changes**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add .gitignore\n",
    "   git commit -m \"Remove virtual environment from tracking and add to .gitignore\"\n",
    "This tells Git to ignore the `venv/` directory, preventing it from being committed to your repository. This keeps your repository clean and avoids including unnecessary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Freeze Libraries into `requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing the necessary libraries for your project, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the dependencies. This file will allow others (and you) to easily recreate the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the following command to generate the `requirements.txt` file:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "4. Install Dash and any other libraries your project needs:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install dash\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "> This will save all installed libraries and their versions into the `requirements.txt` file, which you can commit to your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Initialize a Git Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open the **Git Bash** terminal within VS Code.\n",
    "- Initialize the project folder as a Git repository by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git init\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ensure that Git is configured on your machine. If not, follow [this guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) to configure Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Create a GitHub Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository.\n",
    "- Give the repository a name of your choice (for example, `surveydashboard`).\n",
    "- After the repository is created, copy the repository URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Link Your Local Project to the GitHub Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go back to **VS Code** and, in the Git Bash terminal, link your local project to the GitHub repository by adding the remote URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git remote add origin <your-repository-url>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the URL you copied from GitHub.\n",
    "To set the `main` branch as your default branch in Git, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create or Rename the Branch to `main`\n",
    "If you haven't already created the `main` branch, or if your current default branch is named something else (like `master`), you can rename it to `main`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rename the Current Branch to `main`**:\n",
    "   - First, make sure you are on the branch you want to rename:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git branch -m main\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **If You Need to Create a New `main` Branch**:\n",
    "   - If you don't have a `main` branch yet and want to create one:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git checkout -b main\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Set the `main` Branch as the Default on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're working with a repository hosted on GitHub, you'll also want to set `main` as the default branch on GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Push the `main` Branch to GitHub**:\n",
    "   - If you renamed the branch or created it locally, push it to GitHub:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git push -u origin main\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Change the Default Branch on GitHub**:\n",
    "   - Go to your repository on GitHub.\n",
    "   - Click on \"Settings\" in the repository menu.\n",
    "   - Under \"Branches,\" you'll see an option to change the default branch. Set it to `main`.\n",
    "   - If `main` is not listed, push the branch to GitHub first as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: (Optional) Delete the Old Branch (e.g., `master`)\n",
    "If you had an old default branch like `master` and you no longer need it, you can delete it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Delete the Old Branch Locally**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git branch -d master\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Delete the Old Branch on GitHub**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git push origin --delete master\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "After these steps, `main` will be your default branch both locally and on GitHub.\n",
    "## 8. Add and Commit Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "- After setting up your Git repository, you need to add your project files to be tracked by Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git add .\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Commit the changes with a descriptive message:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git commit -m \"Initial commit for my Dash project\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Push Your Code to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, push your changes to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git push origin main\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Pull changes from the remote repository**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git pull origin main\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **To exit after viewing the `git log`, you need to**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    Press the `q` key.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "This will quit the log view and return you to the command prompt.\n",

    "`git stash` is a Git command that temporarily saves (or \"stashes\") the changes youâ€™ve made in your working directory that you havenâ€™t yet committed.
